Just some notes on performance with Python 3.5.  I am taking this into
account in the code.

- 60% faster to create lists with [] list comprehensions than tuples
  or lists with tuple(), list().  Of those list is 10% faster than
  tuple.

- an implicit default argument is ~5% faster than passing the default
  explicitly

- using a local variable x rather than self.x in loops and list
  comprehensions is over 50% faster

- struct.pack, struct.unpack are over 60% faster than int.to_bytes and
  int.from_bytes.  They are faster little endian (presumably because
  it matches the host) than big endian regardless of length.

- single-item list and tuple unpacking.  Suppose b = (1, )

   a, = b  is a about 0.4% faster than  (a,) = b
           and about 45% faster than a = b[0]

- multiple assignment is faster using tuples only for 3 or more items
