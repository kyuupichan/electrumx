RPC Interface
=============

You can query the status of a running server, and affect its behaviour
by sending **JSON RPC** commands to the LocalRPC port it is listening
on.  This is best done using the :file:`electrumx_rpc` script
provided.

The general form of invocation is::

  electrumx_rpc [-p PORT] <command> [arg1 [arg2...]]

The port to send the commands to can be specified on the command line,
otherwise the environment variable :envvar:`RPC_PORT` is used, and if
that is not set then **8000** is assumed.

The following commands are available:

add_peer
--------

Add a peer to the peers list.  ElectrumX will schdule an immediate
connection attempt.  This command takes a single argument: the peer's
"real name" as it used to advertise itself on IRC::

  $ electrumx_rpc add_peer "ecdsa.net v1.0 s110 t"
  "peer 'ecdsa.net v1.0 s110 t' added"

daemon_url
----------

This command takes an optional argument that is interpreted
identically to the :envvar:`DAEMON_URL` environment variable.  If
omitted, the default argument value is the process's existing
:envvar:`DAEMON_URL` environment variable.

This command replaces the daemon's URL at run-time, and also
forecefully rotates to the first URL in the list.

For example, in case ElectrumX has previously failed over to a
secondary daemon and you want to revert to the primary having resolved
the connectivity issue, invoking this command without an argument will
have that effect.

disconnect
----------

Disonnect the given session IDs or group names.

Session IDs can be obtained in the logs or with the `sessions`_ RPC command.  Group
names can be optained with the `groups`_ RPC command.

The special string :const:`all` disconnects all sessions.

Example::

  $ electrumx_rpc disconnect 209.59.102 34 2
  [
      "disconnecting session 34",
      "disconnecting group 209.59.102"
      "unknown: 2",
  ]

getinfo
-------

Return a summary of server state.  This command takes no arguments.
A typical result is as follows (with annotated comments)::

  $ electrumx_rpc getinfo
  {
      "coin": "BitcoinSegwit",
      "daemon": "127.0.0.1:9334/",
      "daemon height": 572154,         # The daemon's height when last queried

          "server.ping": 6412,
          "server.version": 2866
      },
      "request total": 216820,         # Total requests served
      "sessions": {                    # Live session stats
          "count": 670,
          "count with subs": 45,
          "errors": 0,

          "pending requests": 79,      # Number of requests currently being processed
          "subs": 36292                # Total subscriptions
      },
      "tx hashes cache": "289 lookups 38 hits 213 entries",
      "txs sent": 19,                  # Transactions broadcast
      "uptime": "01h 39m 04s",
      "version": "ElectrumX 1.10.1"
  }

Each ill-formed request, or one that does not follow the Electrum
protocol, increments the error count of the session that sent it.

:ref:`logging <session logging>` of sessions can be enabled by RPC.

For more information on peers see :ref:`here <peers>`.

Clients that are slow to consume data sent to them are :dfn:`paused` until their socket
buffer drains sufficiently, at which point processing of requests resumes.

Apart from very short intervals, typically after a new block or when a client has just
connected, the number of unprocessed requests should be low, say 250 or fewer.  If it is
over 1,000 the server is overloaded.

Sessions are put into groups, primarily as an anti-DoS measure.  Currently each session
goes into two groups: one for an IP subnet, and one based on the timeslice it connected
in.  Each member of a group incurs a fraction of the costs of the other group members.
This appears in the `sessions_` list under the column XCost.

groups
------

Return a list of all current session groups.  Takes no arguments.

The output is quite similar to the `sessions`_ command.

log
---

Toggle logging of the given session IDs or group names.  All incoming requests for a
logged session are written to the server log.  The arguments are case-insensitive.

When a group is specified, logging is toggled for its current members only; there is no
effect on future group members.

Session IDs can be obtained in the logs or with the `sessions`_ RPC command.  Group
names can be optained with the `groups`_ RPC command.

The special string :const:`all` turns on logging of all current and future sessions,
:const:`none` turns off logging of all current and future sessions, and :const:`new`
toggles logging of future sessions.

Example::

  $ electrumx_rpc log new 6 t0 z
  [
    "logging new sessions",
    "logging session 6",
    "logging session 3",
    "logging session 57",
    "logging session 12"
    "unknown: z",
  ]

In the above command sessions 3, 12 and 57 were in group `t0` (in fact, session 6 was
too).

.. _peers:

peers
-----

Return a list of peer Electrum servers serving the same coin network.
This command takes no arguments.

Peer data is obtained via a peer discovery protocol documented
:ref:`here <Peer Discovery>`::

  $ electrumx_rpc peers

.. _query:

query
-----

Run a query of the UTXO and history databases against one or more
addresses, hex scripts or ASCII names (for coins that have an index
on names like Namecoin).  `--limit <N>` or `-l <N>` limits the output
for each kind to that many entries.  History is printed in blockchain
order; UTXOs in an arbitrary order.

For example::

  $ electrumx_rpc query --limit 5 76a91462e907b15cbf27d5425399ebf6f0fb50ebb88f1888ac
  Script: 76a91462e907b15cbf27d5425399ebf6f0fb50ebb88f1888ac

  Balance: 17.8983303 BCH

reorg
-----

Force a block chain reorganisation, primarily for debugging purposes.
This command takes an optional argument - the number of blocks to
reorg - which defaults to 3.

That number of blocks will be backed up - using undo information
stored in ElectrumX's database - and then ElectrumX will move forwards
on the daemon's main chain to its current height.

.. _sessions:

sessions
--------

Return a list of all current sessions.  Takes no arguments::

  ID     Flags            Client Proto    Cost   XCost  Reqs   Txs    Subs    Recv Recv KB    Sent Sent KB      Time                  Peer

The columns show information by session: the session ID, flags (see below), how the client
identifies itself - typically the Electrum client version, the protocol version
negotiated, the session cost, the additional session cost accrued from its groups, the
number of unprocessed requests, the number of transactions sent, the number of address
subscriptions, the number of requests received and their total size, the number of
messages sent and their size, how long the client has been connected, and the client's IP
address (if anonymous logging is disabled).

The flags are:

 * ``S`` an SSL connection
 * ``T`` a TCP connection
 * ``R`` a local RPC connection
 * ``L`` a logged session
 * ``C`` a connection that is being closed
 * the non-negative number is the connection "cost", with lower
   numbers having higher priority.  RPC connections have cost ``0``,
   normal connections have cost at least ``1``.

stop
----

Flush all cached data to disk and shut down the server cleanly, as if
sending the `KILL` signal.  Be patient - during initial sync flushing
all cached data to disk can take several minutes.  This command takes
no arguments.

.. _session logging:
